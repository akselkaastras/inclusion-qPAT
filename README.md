Ground true parameter on fine mesh (left). Sample from a posterior distribution for inclusion detection based on a star-shaped parametrization (middle) and a level set parametrization (right) both on a coarse mesh.
$`10^3`$ samples were computed. This took around $`\sim`$ 1 minute.

## driver.m file
The file `driver.m` demonstrates the main capabilities of this collections of scripts. It:
1. Constructs a triangular finite element mesh for the unit disc based on element size `hmax`. We recommend `hmax>= 0.03` for a smooth initial experience.
2. Samples from prior distributions based on Matern Gaussian fields and the star-shaped set and level set parametrizations.
3. Computes data for a specific ground true parameter on a fine mesh, see <b>Data</b> below.
4. Approximates approximation error arising from fine and coarse mesh differences.
5. Samples a posterior distribution based on the prior distributions and a likelihood arising from white noise observations of $`\langle H, \phi_k \rangle_{L^2(D)} + \varepsilon \xi_k`$, where $`H`$ is the true observation, $`\phi_k`$ are Dirichlet Laplacian eigenfunctions, $`\varepsilon>0`$ is a noise level and $`\xi_k\sim N(0,1)`$ i.i.d. The posterior is sampled using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, the preconditioned Crank-Nicolson (pCN) scheme.


## Parametrizations
Main functions are:
`prior_init.m`
`prior_init2d.m`

returns a structure containing KL (Karhunen-Loeve) eigenfunctions $`\{e_k\}_{k\in \mathbb{Z}^m}`$ and eigenvalues $`\{\lambda_k\}_{k\in \mathbb{Z}^m}`$ truncated corresponding to a user specified max frequency `max_freq` for the Matern covariance.
Given an i.i.d Gaussian vector of same length as the number of eigenfunctions, priorsample.m computes the KL expansion
$$\theta = \sum_{k} \xi_k \sqrt{\lambda_k} e_k.$$

Parametrizations:
`push_forward_levelset2D_smooth.m`
`push_forward_star2D_interp.m`

the first uses continuous approximation of the heaviside function to filter $`\theta`$ .
the second uses `inpoly2.m`

## Finite element scripts
Builds on finite element routines in first order Lagrange basis and discontinuous Galerkin basis. Many of these routines build on code by Niko HÃ¤nninen, Tanja Tarvainen and Ville Kolehmainen (University of Eastern Finland).
Goal of the is to compute $`H = \gamma u`$ given $`(D,\gamma)`$, where $`u`$ solves
$$\nabla \cdot (D \nabla u) + \gamma u = 0 \text{ in } \mathcal{O}, \quad u = f \text{ on } \partial \mathcal{O}.$$
Here we consider the unit disk $\mathcal{O}$. The Dirichlet condition $`f`$ is specified in `make_data.m` as a function $`w_f`$ in $`\mathcal{O}`$ such that $`w_f|_{\mathcal{O}}=f`$. 

## Data
`N=13` and number of Dirichlet eigenfunctions are set to `trunc = N*(2*N+1)`.

## MCMC
Main function is `pCNsampler.m`. This
